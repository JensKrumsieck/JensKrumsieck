## Main Projects
* **PorphyStruct (currently private Repository)**:

  Structural Analysis of Porphyrinoids Molecular structures of porphyrinoid macrocycles can be represented by a linear combination of their vibrational normal modes. With PorphyStruct displacement diagrams can be generated and simulated to gain insight into the conformation of the obtained substance.

* **Chem# (ChemSharp)
  Early stages of a Library for processing of chemistry related files (aiming at spectroscopy and structural files) - To give multiple projects a single codebase

## Recommended Repositories:
